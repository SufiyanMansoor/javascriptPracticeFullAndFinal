# VariablFOr String
var name = "Mark";
Now the variable name refers to the text string "Mark".
Note that it was my choice to call it name. I could have called it myName, xyz, lol, or
something else. It's up to me how to name my variables, within limits.
With the string "Mark" assigned to the variable name, my JavaScript code doesn't have to
specify "Mark" again. Whenever JavaScript encounters name, JavaScript knows that it's a
variable that refers to "Mark".
For example, if you ask JavaScript to print name, it remembers the value that name refers
to, and prints...
Mark
The value that a variable refers to can change.
