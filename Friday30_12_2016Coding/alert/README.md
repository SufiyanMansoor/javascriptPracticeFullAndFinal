# ALERT
An alert is a box that pops up to give the user a message. Here's code for an alert that
displays the message "Thanks for your input!"
alert("Thanks for your input!");
alert is a keyword—that is, a word that has special meaning for JavaScript. It means,
"Display, in an alert box, the message that follows." Note that alert isn't capitalized. If you
capitalize it, the script will stop.
